# Hayden's NixOS System Configurations

This repository contains the complete, declarative configuration for my ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 (GU603ZW), managed with Nix Flakes.

üöÄ Automated Installation
This repository includes an automated script to perform a clean installation of NixOS.

Warning: This process will completely erase all data on the selected disk.

Pre-Installation Steps
Create a Bootable USB: Download the latest NixOS 25.05 GNOME ISO and flash it to a USB drive.

BIOS Settings: Boot from the USB drive. Enter the BIOS/UEFI setup and ensure:

Secure Boot is Disabled.

The system is in UEFI Mode.

Connect to the Internet: Once in the NixOS live environment, connect to your Wi-Fi or an Ethernet network.

Identify GPU Bus IDs (CRITICAL): This is the only manual step required. Open a terminal and run:bash
lspci | grep -E "VGA|3D"

You will see output similar to this:

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation...
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation...

*   Note the two numbers (e.g., `00:02.0` for Intel and `01:00.0` for NVIDIA).
*   You will need to edit the `modules/system/hardware/asus-zephyrus-m16.nix` file in your GitHub repository and replace the placeholder `intelBusId` and `nvidiaBusId` values with the correct ones for your machine. The format is `PCI:X:Y:Z`. For example, `01:00.0` becomes `"PCI:1:0:0"`.

The script will guide you through the final confirmation before partitioning the drive and installing your system. Once it's finished, the laptop will reboot into your new, fully configured NixOS installation.
